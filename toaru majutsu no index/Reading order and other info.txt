This batch file was updated on August 22, 2018.

Reading order:
Volume 1-13
Volume SS1
Volume 14-16
Volume SS2
Volume 17-22
New Testament series

Season 1 of the Index anime covered volumes 1-6. Season 2 covered volumes 7-13+SS1. If you have seen season 1 and 2 and want to know where to pick up the novels from,
I would urge you start at the very beginning. However, if you really don't want to do that, my suggestion would be to read chapter 3 of volume SS1, which wasn't adapted in season 2,
then start at 14. Additionally, you may want to read the epilogue of volume 6 and the epilogue of volume 13 for further clarification of future events.


For side stories:
Volume SP and Kanzaki SS should be read at some point before starting New Testament. I would recommend reading them after either volume 18 or 22.


For the remaining side stories, I will list what volume the story was on when the side/parody story was released.
Be aware that several of these stories will contain characters and spoilers for events up to the listed volume.

I don't necessarily recommend reading these right after you've read the listed volumes. This is here to give you context to when they were released and to avoid spoilers.
